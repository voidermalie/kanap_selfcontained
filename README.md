# Hello 🛍️

## 🛒Overview:
Originally, this project was designed to interface with a genuine API and back-end code provided by my academic institution. To showcase its capabilities, I initially deployed the back-end on Heroku.

## 🛒Current Version:
In order to make the project more self-contained and easily accessible for demonstration purposes, I have since suspended the Heroku deployment. The data, which was previously fetched from the API, is now integrated directly into the front-end as a JSON file. Additionally, the order simulation, which was once processed on the back-end using the uuid package, has been re-implemented as a front-end function.

## 🛒Features
    - Developed entirely in vanilla JavaScript
    - Integrated dynamic product fetching from an API
    - Performed advanced DOM manipulation for product display
    - Created a persistent cart with color and quantity selection using localStorage
    - Implemented real-time cart updates for total quantity and total amount due
    - Set up user input verification at the contact form
    - Simulated order placement with confirmation and order number generation
